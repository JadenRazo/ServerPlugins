# SERVER AFK - ADMIN QUICK START
# ========================================
#
# Basic Setup:
#   1. Set positions: /wa p1 and /wa p2 (or use quickcreate)
#   2. Open GUI: /wa
#   3. Create zone and configure rewards
#   4. Set hologram: Stand in zone and /wa holo
#
# Y-Level Setup:
#   - Y-levels are automatically set from p1/p2 positions
#   - OR use: /wa quickcreate <name> [radius] [height]
#   - Example: /wa quickcreate "Mining Zone" 15 10
#     Creates 31x21x31 zone (radius*2+1 by height*2+1)
#   - The zone includes all blocks from minY to maxY (inclusive)
#
# Reward Chance Setup:
#   - Use the GUI (/wa) to edit reward chances
#   - Click on a reward, then Shift+Click to adjust chance
#   - 100% = always give, 50% = half the time, 1% = rare
#
# Commands:
#   /wa              - Open admin GUI
#   /wa p1           - Set corner 1
#   /wa p2           - Set corner 2
#   /wa quickcreate  - Create zone at your location
#   /wa holo         - Add hologram to zone
#   /wa reload       - Reload configuration
#   /afk             - Player AFK toggle

# ServerAFK Configuration

# Database settings
# Supported types: H2, MARIADB (or MYSQL)
database:
  type: MARIADB
  # H2 settings (only used if type is H2)
  file: afkzones
  # MariaDB/MySQL settings (only used if type is MARIADB or MYSQL)
  host: localhost
  port: 3306

# Default settings for new zones
defaults:
  time-interval: 300
  reward-type: CURRENCY
  currency-amount: 100
  y-axis-forgiveness: 3  # Blocks of vertical movement allowed without leaving zone (for jumping)

  # Y-Level Configuration Guide:
  # - Y-levels are set when creating a zone with /wa p1 and /wa p2
  # - The zone boundary includes minY to maxY (inclusive)
  # - Use y-axis-forgiveness to allow jumping without exiting
  # - Example: Zone from Y=60 to Y=80 allows 20 blocks vertical space
  # - Tip: Use /wa quickcreate <name> [radius] [height] for easy setup
  #   - height parameter creates ±height from player Y position
  #   - /wa quickcreate "Mine" 10 5 = 10 block radius, ±5 blocks vertically

# Rank reward multipliers (applied to currency rewards)
# Players with these LuckPerms groups get multiplied rewards
rank-multipliers:
